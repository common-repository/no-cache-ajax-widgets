== Description ==

You want your site to be fast, so you added caching… but now you have a new challenge: you have content that shouldn’t be cached, such as ads, feeds, rotating ads, videos, shopping carts, and more.

With No Cache AJAX Widgets, you simply drag and drop the new AJAX-powered widgets to any widget area, add your content, and you are done. No more messing with your theme files, functions.php, fragmented caching, mfunc, and others, or excluding an entire page from caching.
